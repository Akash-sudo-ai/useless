### Project Description
The Inevitable Hero is a unique anti-platformer where you don't play as the hero. Instead, your goal is to stop the unstoppable by dragging and dropping obstacles into his path, only to watch your efforts hilariously backfire as he inevitably reaches his goal.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In the game "The Inevitable Hero" the ridiculous problem you're solving is how to stop an unstoppable force using tools that actively help it succeed. 

It's a complete reversal of a typical video game problem.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The unspoken "solution" to a game about the futility of resistance isn't to win, but to finally understand the rules and change your role. The solution is to stop trying to delay the inevitable and instead, become its greatest champion.The only logical move is to abandon the futile struggle and find satisfaction in helping the inevitable arrive as quickly as possible.
